        <h1 id="When-will-the-Paradise-Casino-reopen-on-Guam"><a href="#When-will-the-Paradise-Casino-reopen-on-Guam" class="headerlink" title="When will the Paradise Casino reopen on Guam?"></a>When will the Paradise Casino reopen on Guam?</h1><p>The Paradise Casino is a casino resort on the island of Guam, in the United States territory of Guam. The casino has been closed since it sustained heavy damage from Typhoon Soulik in July 2013.</p>
<p>On March 3, 2016, it was announced that the Paradise Casino will reopen on April 15, 2016. The casino resort is expected to include a new hotel, restaurants, and a retail area. The opening of the casino has been delayed several times in the past.</p>
<h1 id="What-caused-the-Paradise-Casino-to-close-on-Guam"><a href="#What-caused-the-Paradise-Casino-to-close-on-Guam" class="headerlink" title="What caused the Paradise Casino to close on Guam?"></a>What caused the Paradise Casino to close on Guam?</h1><p>The Paradise Casino on Guam north of Hagåtña closed its doors in late February 2019, leaving about 240 employees out of work. The shutdown was a complete surprise to the casino’s employees, who showed up for work one day and found the casino’s doors locked.</p>
<p>No official explanation has been given for the closure. Some believe that it may be related to the ongoing legal battle between the casino’s owner, AGDC, and its former tenant, Imperial Pacific International Holdings Limited (IPIHL).</p>
<p>In November 2018, IPIHL filed a lawsuit against AGDC, seeking damages of over $1 billion. The suit alleges that AGDC reneged on a contract signed in 2015 which would have allowed IPIHL to operate the casino.</p>
<p>AGDC has denied any wrongdoing, and has claimed that IPIHL failed to uphold its end of the agreement. In a statement released after the closure of the Paradise Casino, AGDC said that it was “deeply disappointed with IPIHL’s actions and their impact on our employees and our community.”</p>
<p>The future of the Paradise Casino remains uncertain. In the meantime, its former employees are scrambling to find new jobs.</p>
<h1 id="When-is-the-expected-reopening-date-for-the-Paradise-Casino"><a href="#When-is-the-expected-reopening-date-for-the-Paradise-Casino" class="headerlink" title="When is the expected reopening date for the Paradise Casino?"></a>When is the expected reopening date for the Paradise Casino?</h1><p>Paradise Casino is scheduled to reopen on December 22, just in time for the holiday season! The casino has been closed since June due to the devastating wildfires that swept through the area. Many employees have been out of work since then, so this is great news for them.</p>
<p>The casino is expected to be back up and running with all its usual games and attractions. This will be a welcome sight for the community, which has been struggling since the fires. The casino employs hundreds of people, so its reopening will bring much-needed jobs and economic stimulus to the area.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the Paradise Casino will be busy in the weeks leading up to Christmas! Be sure to stop by and check out all the festivities.</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-updates-on-when-the-Paradise-Casino-will-reopen"><a href="#Are-there-any-updates-on-when-the-Paradise-Casino-will-reopen" class="headerlink" title="Are there any updates on when the Paradise Casino will reopen?"></a>Are there any updates on when the Paradise Casino will reopen?</h1><p>As of now, there is no clear indication as to when the Paradise Casino will reopen. The latest reports suggest that the casino may not be open until late 2019 or early 2020. This timeline is still tentative and could change depending on a number of factors.</p>
<p>The Paradise Casino was badly damaged by the Camp Fire in November 2018. The building was completely destroyed, and the property suffered significant damage as well. Rebuilding efforts are underway, but they are expected to take some time.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Paradise Casino’s staff and customers are dealing with the aftermath of the fire. Many people have lost their homes and livelihoods in the disaster, and the casino provides a much-needed source of income for many locals.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the Paradise Casino will reopen in light of these circumstances. However, we can be sure that it will reopen eventually and that it will continue to be a major employer and community asset in Northern California.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-plans-for-the-Paradise-Casino-once-it-reopens"><a href="#What-are-the-plans-for-the-Paradise-Casino-once-it-reopens" class="headerlink" title="What are the plans for the Paradise Casino once it reopens?"></a>What are the plans for the Paradise Casino once it reopens?</h1><p>The Paradise Casino is scheduled to reopen on May 1, 2019. According to the casino’s website, they are “currently renovating our gaming floor and restaurants with new amenities and features that we know our guests will love.” So far, there has been no announcements about what the new plans are for the casino.</p>
<p>The Paradise Casino is located in Biloxi, Mississippi. It first opened in 1992 with only slots and video poker machines. In 1995, they began offering table games. In 2009, they were acquired by Boyd Gaming Corporation. In 2012, they underwent a $10 million renovation which added a new poker room, high limit area, and buffet.</p>
<p>The most recent closure of the casino came after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The casino shut down for six months due to damage from the hurricane. It then closed again in August of 2010 when Mississippi legalized gambling on cruise ships. This led to a decline in business for the casino and it eventually closed its doors for good in February of 2011.</p>
<p>There is no word yet on what the exact plans are for the reopening of the casino, but we can certainly expect something big!</p>
