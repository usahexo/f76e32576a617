        <h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-to-Close-Down-Following-Revenue-Losses"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-to-Close-Down-Following-Revenue-Losses" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia to Close Down Following Revenue Losses"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia to Close Down Following Revenue Losses</h1><p>Philadelphia’s SugarHouse Casino is to close down following revenue losses. According to Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board data, the casino has seen a year-over-year decrease in revenue of more than $10 million.</p>
<p>“The closure of SugarHouse Casino is regrettable but necessary,” said state Rep. Chris Rabb, who represents the district that includes the casino. “This is indicative of the broader gambling industry landscape in Atlantic City and Chester County.”</p>
<p>The casino opened in 2010 and employs around 1,000 people. It is the second Philadelphia-area casino to close in recent months, after Parx Casino shuttered its Hollywood studio location in December.</p>
<p>SugarHouse has been dealt a difficult hand in recent years. The opening of new casinos in neighboring states has taken away much of its customer base, and its location on the Delaware River has made it difficult to compete with casinos located closer to urban areas.</p>
<p>In a statement, the casino said it had “made every effort to remain competitive” but that “market conditions have proven too challenging.” It added that it was working with employees to help them find new jobs.</p>
<h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-to-Remain-Open-Following-Settlement-Agreement"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-to-Remain-Open-Following-Settlement-Agreement" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia to Remain Open Following Settlement Agreement"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia to Remain Open Following Settlement Agreement</h1><p>The SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia will remain open after the casino’s owner reached a settlement agreement with the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The settlement agreement comes after the state of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against the casino’s owner, Philadelphia Entertainment and Development Partners (PEDP), in an attempt to block the casino from opening.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said that the state reached a settlement agreement with PEDP that will allow the casino to remain open while the company undergoes a series of reforms.</p>
<p>“My office will work with PEDP to ensure they meet their obligations under this agreement, which includes protecting taxpayers and ensuring gaming is conducted fairly and honestly at SugarHouse Casino,” Shapiro said.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement agreement, PEDP agreed to make a series of reforms to the casino, including hiring an independent monitor to oversee operations. The company also agreed to pay $4 million to the state.</p>
<p>SugarHouse Casino opened in 2010 and has been embroiled in a number of legal disputes with the state. In 2016, the state sued PEDP for violating its gaming license by using two former executives of the now-closed Atlantic City casino Trump Taj Mahal as consultants for SugarHouse Casino.</p>
<h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Set-to-Lose-Tax-Free-Status"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Set-to-Lose-Tax-Free-Status" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Set to Lose Tax-Free Status"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Set to Lose Tax-Free Status</h1><p>The SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia may soon lose its tax-free status, jeopardizing the casino’s future operations. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania ruled this week that the casino must start paying $40 million in taxes annually, a move that could force the casino to close its doors.</p>
<p>SugarHouse has long been exempt from paying taxes since it opened in 2010. The casino had argued that it should be exempt from taxes because it is located on Philadelphia’s waterfront and falls under the city’s jurisdiction. However, the court ruled this week that SugarHouse is actually located in the neighboring borough of Fishtown, making it subject to state and local taxes.</p>
<p>The decision is a major blow to the casino, which has already suffered from low revenues and layoffs over the past year. The casino has promised to appeal the ruling, but if it is ultimately forced to pay taxes, it may be unable to stay afloat.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-Philadelphia"><a href="#What-Does-This-Mean-for-Philadelphia" class="headerlink" title="What Does This Mean for Philadelphia?"></a>What Does This Mean for Philadelphia?</h1><p>The SugarHouse Casino is a major employer in Philadelphia, with over 1,500 workers. If the casino closes its doors, it will have a devastating impact on the local economy. In addition, the city would lose out on millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.</p>
<p>Philadelphia officials are hopeful that SugarHouse will be able to appeal the ruling and keep its doors open. However, if the casino does end up closing, it will leave a significant hole in the city’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Facing-Closure-Amidst-Mounting-Debt"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Facing-Closure-Amidst-Mounting-Debt" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Facing Closure Amidst Mounting Debt"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Facing Closure Amidst Mounting Debt</h1><p>The SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia is facing closure amidst mounting debt. According to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the casino is more than $286 million in debt. This has led to speculation that the casino may be forced to close its doors.</p>
<p>The casino has been struggling with debt for some time now. In 2017, it was reported that the casino was more than $180 million in debt. At the time, it was believed that the debt would be manageable. However, the situation has only worsened in recent months.</p>
<p>The closure of the SugarHouse Casino would be a major blow to Philadelphia’s economy. The casino employs more than 2,500 people and generates millions of dollars in revenue each year. It also helped attract other businesses to the city’s waterfront district.</p>
<p>If the casino does close, it is not clear what will happen to its employees. Some of them may be able to find jobs at other casinos in the area, but many others may find themselves out of work.</p>
<p>In addition to its debt problems, the SugarHouse Casino has also been hit by allegations of corruption. Last year, two former executives of the casino were indicted on charges of fraud and money laundering. The two men are accused of taking millions of dollars from the casino for their personal benefit.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the SugarHouse Casino will survive its financial troubles or if it will be forced to close its doors</p>
<h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Seeks-to-Raise-Money-Via-Tax-Hike"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Seeks-to-Raise-Money-Via-Tax-Hike" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Seeks to Raise Money Via Tax Hike"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Seeks to Raise Money Via Tax Hike</h1><p>Philadelphia’s SugarHouse Casino is hoping to secure an increase in taxes from its current rate of 54 percent to 58 percent in order to improve its financial position. The casino, which opened in 2010, has been unable to keep pace with its rivals in terms of revenue and profits. </p>
<p>The casino currently pays more than $40 million in taxes to the city and state. In order to make up for lost profits, the casino is now seeking permission from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to raise its tax rate. The higher taxes would bring in an additional $8 million per year. </p>
<p>While the hike is modest, it would still be a welcomed relief for SugarHouse Casino, which has seen its revenue decline by 11 percent over the past two years. In addition, the casino has seen its share of winning players fall from 31 percent in 2016 to 26 percent last year. This decline has led to a drop in profits from $43 million in 2016 to $33 million last year. </p>
<p>Opposition to the proposed tax increase is expected, especially from other casinos in the state that are struggling to remain profitable. One such casino, Presque Isle Downs and Casino, has already announced that it will close down if the tax hike is approved. </p>
<p>Despite the opposition, SugarHouse Casino says that it needs the extra money in order to continue growing and competing against other casinos in the area.</p>
