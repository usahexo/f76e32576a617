        <h1 id="NBA-Plans-to-Sell-Data-for-Overseas-Players-in-2017"><a href="#NBA-Plans-to-Sell-Data-for-Overseas-Players-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="NBA Plans to Sell Data for Overseas Players in 2017"></a>NBA Plans to Sell Data for Overseas Players in 2017</h1><p>The NBA has big plans for its data in 2017. The organization is looking to sell its data to overseas teams in order to improve player development.</p>
<p>“We have more information than ever before about our players, and we believe this will give us a competitive edge as we continue to develop players around the world,” said NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum.</p>
<p>The NBA already sells its data to teams in the United States, but this is the first time that the league will be selling information to teams outside of the country. NBA teams are eager to get their hands on the data so they can improve their players’ performance.</p>
<p>The data includes information such as how fast a player runs, how high they jump, and how well they shoot from different parts of the court. This information can be used to help coaches create better training programs for their players.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this new venture will help the NBA grow its international audience. In addition, selling data to overseas teams could also help the NBA establish new relationships with international broadcasters.</p>
<h1 id="Soccer-Leagues-Poised-to-Take-Advantage-of-NBA-Data-Selling-Plan"><a href="#Soccer-Leagues-Poised-to-Take-Advantage-of-NBA-Data-Selling-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Soccer Leagues Poised to Take Advantage of NBA Data Selling Plan"></a>Soccer Leagues Poised to Take Advantage of NBA Data Selling Plan</h1><p>The NBA announced a plan to sell data from its games to interested organizations and businesses, such as soccer leagues. The data will include player and team statistics, as well as camera angles used during the game.</p>
<p>This move could create opportunities for leagues around the world to improve their product. For example, soccer leagues in England and Spain are interested in the data in order to learn more about their own players and teams. They could also use the data to study how other teams play, and then create strategies to counter those tactics.</p>
<p>The NBA has been collecting this data for many years, so it has a large pool of information that organizations can access. This wealth of data could help soccer leagues improve their game productions, which could result in more viewership and revenue.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-Looks-to-Cash-In-on-NBA-Decision-to-Sell-Player-Data"><a href="#MLB-Looks-to-Cash-In-on-NBA-Decision-to-Sell-Player-Data" class="headerlink" title="MLB Looks to Cash In on NBA Decision to Sell Player Data"></a>MLB Looks to Cash In on NBA Decision to Sell Player Data</h1><p>Major League Baseball is getting in on the NBA action by selling player data to interested parties. The data being offered for sale includes things such as how much players run, their shooting percentages from different areas of the court, and how often they commit turnovers.</p>
<p>This move comes in light of the NBA deciding to allow outside groups to purchase player data. This decision was made in order to bring in more revenue for the league and its players.</p>
<p>MLB has been collecting this data for years, so it has a head start on the competition. It is now looking to cash in by offering access to this data to interested businesses and organizations.</p>
<p>There are many potential uses for this data. For example, it could be used by teams looking to improve their roster or by coaches looking to make tactical adjustments during a game. It could also be used by broadcasters who want to provide more detailed analysis of games.</p>
<p>The NBA has been selling player data since 2013, and it has been a big success. MLB is hoping to replicate that success with its new venture.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-Could-Follow-Suit-as-NBA-Moves-Forward-with-Player-Data-Sale"><a href="#NFL-Could-Follow-Suit-as-NBA-Moves-Forward-with-Player-Data-Sale" class="headerlink" title="NFL Could Follow Suit as NBA Moves Forward with Player Data Sale"></a>NFL Could Follow Suit as NBA Moves Forward with Player Data Sale</h1><p>The National Football League (NFL) could be the next major sports league to follow the NBA in selling player data to tech companies. The NBA announced last month that it would be selling player data to firms such as Microsoft and Amazon. The NFL is now in discussions with several major tech companies about a similar deal, according to a report from Reuters.</p>
<p>The NFL has long been known for its reluctance to share data with third-party companies. However, the league is now seeing the value of selling that data as it looks for new sources of revenue. The NBA’s deal with Microsoft, for example, is worth $250 million over five years.</p>
<p>The NFL is currently in discussions with a number of major tech companies, including Google, Facebook, IBM, and Apple. It’s unclear how much money the league could make from a data sale, but it’s likely that the amount would be comparable to the NBA’s deal.</p>
<p>This move by the NFL comes as its television ratings continue to decline. In fact,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> viewership for NFL games was down by 9.7% during the 2017 season. This decline has led some to question the long-term viability of the sport.</p>
<p>Selling player data could help offset some of these declines. By partnering with tech companies, the NFL can access new audiences and generate new revenue streams. It will be interesting to see if this trend continues in other major sports leagues and whether or not it helps stem the tide of declining viewership numbers.</p>
<h1 id="NHL-May-Look-to-Partner-with-NBA-as-League-Announces-Plan-to-Sell-Player-Data"><a href="#NHL-May-Look-to-Partner-with-NBA-as-League-Announces-Plan-to-Sell-Player-Data" class="headerlink" title="NHL May Look to Partner with NBA as League Announces Plan to Sell Player Data"></a>NHL May Look to Partner with NBA as League Announces Plan to Sell Player Data</h1><p>The National Hockey League has announced a new plan to sell player data to third-party companies as the league looks to partner with the NBA.</p>
<p>The NHL has been at the forefront of using data to improve the fan experience, with initiatives such as puck and player tracking. This latest move is seen as an attempt to monetize that data and further grow the league’s business.</p>
<p>“This opens up a whole bunch of new opportunities for us,” said NHL Chief Commercial Officer Keith Wachtel.</p>
<p>One key area that is expected to be targeted is fantasy sports. The NBA has long enjoyed a strong relationship with the fantasy sports industry, with players frequently appearing on the cover of fantasy sports magazines.</p>
<p>“The next step is taking all this great data we have and create products that our fans will love and want to consume,” said Wachtel.</p>
<p>The NHLPA has already given its approval for the plan and is expected to receive a portion of the revenue generated from sales of the data.</p>
