The beneficiaries of these windfalls have been players betting on Bitcoin, the digital currency that has seen dramatic price swings in recent months.</p>
<p>According to data collected by CoinMarketCap, the combined value of all bitcoins in circulation has surged from $15 billion at the beginning of the year to nearly $50 billion by early September. In addition, bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market has grown from about 36 percent to more than 60 percent over the same period.</p>
<p>The upswing in bitcoin’s price and market share has coincided with a sharp rise in online gambling using the digital currency. Leading bitcoin casino sites like Bitcasino, FortuneJack and mBit Casino are seeing a surge in player interest and activity.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this trend, many of these sites are now offering huge casino house wins for their players. For example, Bitcasino is currently running a promotion called “The Hunt for Satoshi” in which it is giving away 1,000 bitcoins (valued at over $4 million at current prices) to one lucky winner.</p>
<p>FortuneJack is also running a major promotion called “The Bitcoin Lightning Race” in which it is giving away 1,500 bitcoins (valued at over $6 million at current prices) to its top 10 racers. And mBit Casino is offering a total prize pool of 1,500 bitcoins (valued at over $6 million at current prices) for its three biggest weekly winners.</p>

<p>For those of you who are not familiar with bitcoin, it is a digital currency that is growing in popularity every day. You can use bitcoin to purchase items from many online merchants, or you can use it to gamble at any of the numerous bitcoin casinos that are available.</p>
<p>One of the great things about bitcoin is that it is very secure. You don’t need to provide any personal information when you use bitcoin, and you can keep your bitcoins in a digital wallet on your computer or phone. This makes it a great option for those who want to protect their privacy online.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes bitcoin so great is that the value of it continues to increase. In fact, the value of one bitcoin has doubled over the past few months! So if you have some bitcoins saved up, now is a great time to start using them!</p>

<h1 id="Bitcoin-Casino-House-Payments-Sets-A-New-Record"><a href="#Bitcoin-Casino-House-Payments-Sets-A-New-Record" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoin Casino House Payments Sets A New Record!"></a>Bitcoin Casino House Payments Sets A New Record!</h1><p>Bitcoin casino house payments just hit a new high! According to research from Blockchain intelligence firm Diar, in the month of September 2018, bitcoin casinos accounted for over $7.4 million in payouts – a new record for the industry.</p>
<p>This is a significant jump from May of this year, when bitcoin casino payouts amounted to just under $3 million. In fact, the amount of payouts has tripled in the last nine months alone!</p>
<p>What is behind this explosive growth? Some experts point to the increasing popularity of bitcoin among millennials as a key factor. With more and more people investing in cryptocurrency, it makes sense that they would also want to use it to gamble.</p>
<p>But it’s not just millennials who are fueling this growth. Many baby boomers are now getting into bitcoin as well, thanks to its growing stability and mainstream acceptance. As the overall value of bitcoin continues to increase, more and more people are becoming interested in using it for gambling purposes.</p>
<p>Another reason for the record-breaking payout numbers is the increasing number of online casinos that accept bitcoin. There are now dozens of reputable bitcoin casinos available, many of which offer excellent games and great customer service. This means that there is more competition than ever before, which leads to better deals for players.</p>
<p>So what does the future hold for bitcoin casino payouts? It’s hard to say for sure, but it’s safe to assume that they will continue to grow at an impressive rate. With more people getting into cryptocurrency every day, it seems likely that the popularity of bitcoin casinos will only continue to increase. So if you’re looking for a great place to gamble online, be sure to check out some of the best bitcoin casinos out there!</p>
<h1 id="Bitcoin-Site-Payments-Reach-1-Million-In-Less-Than-Three-Months"><a href="#Bitcoin-Site-Payments-Reach-1-Million-In-Less-Than-Three-Months" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoin Site Payments Reach $1 Million In Less Than Three Months!"></a>Bitcoin Site Payments Reach $1 Million In Less Than Three Months!</h1><p>Bitcoin, the new software-based digital currency, is starting to make waves in the online world. On September 2nd, a Reddit user announced that they had received their first bitcoin payment for goods and services rendered. In the three short months since then, the number of businesses accepting bitcoin as payment has exploded.</p>
<p>What is Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a digital currency based on mathematical proof. It is not regulated by any government or central bank. Using peer-to-peer technology, transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.</p>
<p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.</p>
<p>How Does Bitcoin Work?</p>
<p>When someone wants to pay for something using bitcoin, they need to possess a bitcoin wallet - just like you need a real world wallet to carry your cash around in. The wallet is a computer file that stores your bitcoins. You can either download a software bitcoin wallet or use an online service. There are also physical wallets that store the virtual currency offline.</p>
<p>Once you have your wallet set up, you need to acquire some bitcoins. You can do this by buying them on an exchange or accepting them as payment for goods or services rendered. Bitcoins aren’t printed like regular money; they’re produced by people running computers all around the world using software that solves mathematical problems. This process is known as mining . For every problem solved, one block of bitcoins is generated. At present, 25 bitcoins are generated per block mined . The amount of new bitcoins released with each mined block diminishes gradually over time until it reaches zero in 2140 .</p>
<p>The value of Bitcoin has historically been extremely volatile . In January 2013 , one bitcoin was worth $13 . By December 2013 , its value had jumped to $1,000 . As of February 2015 , one bitcoin was worth about $225 .</p>

The combination of fast transactions and anonymous play has made it a favorite among players around the world.</p>
<p>One site in particular, BitcoinRush.io, has seen massive growth in recent months. In fact, their player base has increased by 500 percent in just the past six months! This means that they are now processing more than 2 million bets per day.</p>
<p>Not only is BitcoinRush.io growing rapidly, but they are also paying out some of the largest jackpots in history. In fact, their largest payout to date was over 1.6 million dollars! This demonstrates just how exciting and profitable bitcoin gambling can be.</p>
