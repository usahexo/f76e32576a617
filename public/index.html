But which ones have the best odds for winning? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>The first game we’ll look at is blackjack. When played correctly, blackjack has a house edge of around 0.5%. This means that if you play blackjack perfectly, you will only lose about 50 cents for every $100 you bet.</p>

The fact of the matter is that casinos have an edge over players, no matter how smart or lucky you think you are. However, there are ways to play casino games that give you the best chance of winning.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack"><a href="#Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack"></a>Blackjack</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the simplest casino games to play, but it also offers some of the best odds for winning. To give yourself the best chance of winning, always bet on blackjack using basic strategy. This involves making certain bets and playing in a specific way based on the cards you are dealt. You can find basic strategy charts online to help you make the right decisions while playing blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="Roulette"><a href="#Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Roulette"></a>Roulette</h1><p>Roulette is a game that involves spinning a wheel with numbered slots and betting on which number or combination of numbers the ball will land in once the wheel stops spinning. The odds of winning at roulette depend on what type of bet you make. The simplest bet is a single number, which pays out at 35-1 if you guess correctly. However, the odds of winning this type of bet are slim - just 2.7%. If you want better odds, consider betting on multiple numbers or combinations instead. This increases your chances of winning but also decreases your potential payout if you guess correctly.</p>
<h1 id="Slots"><a href="#Slots" class="headerlink" title="Slots"></a>Slots</h1><p>Slots are by far the easiest casino game to play, and they offer some of the worst odds for winning. The average house edge on slots is around 10%, so your chances of walking away a winner are pretty slim. However, there are a few strategies you can use to improve your chances somewhat: always play maximum bet; choose machines with higher payouts; and avoid progressive jackpot machines.</p>

<p>#2 Craps</p>
<p>Craps is another popular casino game that offers players good odds for winning. The game is a dice game that involves betting on the outcome of rolling two dice. There are a number of different bets that can be made in craps, giving players plenty of options when it comes to placing their bets.</p>
<p>#3 Roulette</p>
<p>Roulette is another casino game that offers players good odds for winning. The game involves betting on the outcome of a spinning wheel with numbers from 0 to 36 listed on it. Players can bet on a number, color, or other symbol to win their bet.</p>

<ol>
<li>Invest in yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best ways to turn your bonus into real cash winnings is to invest in yourself. This might mean taking a class or paying for coaching to help you improve your skills. It could also mean investing in new equipment or software that will make you more productive and efficient at work.

<ol start="2">
<li>Start or invest in a side hustle.</li>
</ol>
<p>A great way to turn your bonus into real cash winnings is to start or invest in a side hustle. A side hustle can be anything from starting a small business to freelancing on the side.

<h1 id="The-Best-Way-to-Maximize-Your-Casino-Bonuses"><a href="#The-Best-Way-to-Maximize-Your-Casino-Bonuses" class="headerlink" title="The Best Way to Maximize Your Casino Bonuses"></a>The Best Way to Maximize Your Casino Bonuses</h1><p>Casino bonuses can be a great way to bolster your bankroll and give you a little extra playing power as you explore the casino games. However, many players don’t take full advantage of these bonuses, simply because they don’t know how to go about it. In this article, we’re going to show you the best way to maximize your casino bonuses.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it’s important to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions associated with any casino bonus that you decide to claim. This includes things like wagering requirements and time limits. If you can meet these requirements, then it will be much easier for you to get the most out of your bonus.</p>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of the terms and conditions, it’s time to start thinking about how you can best use your bonus. One of the best ways to do this is by using it to play high- variance slots games. These games offer the potential for big wins, but they also come with a higher risk. If you hit a big win, then you can easily clear the wagering requirements for your bonus – but if you lose, then you may not be able to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Another great way to use your casino bonus is by playing table games . Most table games allow players to bet low and high amounts, which makes them ideal for clearing bonuses. In addition, table games usually come with lower odds than slots games, so you have a better chance of winning in the long run.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to remember that casino bonuses are not just for new players . Many casinos offer reload bonuses , which are designed for existing players. These bonuses are often smaller than new player bonuses, but they still offer a great way to boost your bankroll. So be sure to check out the reload bonuses offered by your favourite casino!</p>
<h1 id="Tips-for-Making-the-Most-of-Your-Casino-Bonuses"><a href="#Tips-for-Making-the-Most-of-Your-Casino-Bonuses" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Making the Most of Your Casino Bonuses"></a>Tips for Making the Most of Your Casino Bonuses</h1><p>There are a lot of casino bonuses available on the internet, and it can be tough to know which ones are the best to take advantage of. In this article, we will give you some tips for making the most of your casino bonuses.</p>
<p>One thing to remember is that not all casino bonuses are created equal. Some bonuses will have stricter terms and conditions than others, so it’s important to do your research before you choose one.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for getting the most out of your casino bonus:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you read the terms and conditions thoroughly before you claim a bonus. This way, you’ll know what you’re getting yourself into and won’t be disappointed later on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only accept bonuses that are worth your time. There’s no point in accepting a bonus that has impossible wagering requirements or low value. Look for bonuses that have reasonable playthrough requirements and decent value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the bonus money to play your favourite games. This is the best way to get the most out of your bonus. By playing games that you enjoy, you’ll increase your chances of winning and make the whole experience more enjoyable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be patient and take your time. It can take a while to clear a casino bonus, so don’t rush things. Play at a comfortable pace and make sure you understand all the terms and conditions before trying to cash out any winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have fun! Casino bonuses are meant to be enjoyed, so make sure you take the time to enjoy them. Relax and have some fun while you gamble online!</p>
</li>

How old do you have to be to get into a casino in Las Vegas?"></a>Son, you’re too young to get into a casino in Las Vegas.2. How old do you have to be to get into a casino in Las Vegas?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer to this question as casinos in Las Vegas vary in their age requirements. However, the general rule of thumb is that you must be at least 21 years old to enter a casino in Las Vegas. This applies to both locals and visitors alike.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, the Excalibur Hotel and Casino allows guests 18 and over on weekdays from 6 am to 11 pm and on weekends from 8 am to 11 pm. The Mirage also has a similar policy, allowing guests 18 and over during most hours of the day with the exception of 9 pm to 5 am when it is 21+.</p>
<p>If you are looking to gamble but are not quite of legal age yet, there are other options available for you in Las Vegas. Many of the hotels have arcades with games that do not require identification for entry. There are also a number of attractions in Las Vegas such as the fountains at Bellagio or the lions at MGM Grand that do not require you to be 21 years old or older.</p>

How old do I have to be to get into a casino in Las Vegas?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer as there are different casinos which have their own age requirements. However, the legal gambling age in Las Vegas is 21 years old so most casinos will require you to be at least that age to gamble. There are a few exceptions though, such as the Golden Nugget which allows 18-year-olds to gamble – but only if they are accompanied by someone over 21.</p>
<h1 id="5-Can-I-bring-my-18-year-old-son-into-a-casino-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#5-Can-I-bring-my-18-year-old-son-into-a-casino-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="5. Can I bring my 18 year old son into a casino in Las Vegas?"></a>5. Can I bring my 18 year old son into a casino in Las Vegas?</h1><p>The answer to this question depends on the casino. Most casinos in Las Vegas have an age limit of 21, but some casinos will allow 18 year olds. The best way to find out is to call the casino you are interested in and ask them directly.</p>
<p>If your son is 18 years old or older, he can enter the casino, but he cannot gamble. He can only play slot machines if he is accompanied by someone over the age of 21. If your son is under 18 years old, he cannot enter the casino at all.</p>

        <h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-to-Close-Down-Following-Revenue-Losses"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-to-Close-Down-Following-Revenue-Losses" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia to Close Down Following Revenue Losses"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia to Close Down Following Revenue Losses</h1><p>Philadelphia’s SugarHouse Casino is to close down following revenue losses. According to Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board data, the casino has seen a year-over-year decrease in revenue of more than $10 million.</p>
<p>“The closure of SugarHouse Casino is regrettable but necessary,” said state Rep. Chris Rabb, who represents the district that includes the casino. “This is indicative of the broader gambling industry landscape in Atlantic City and Chester County.”</p>
<p>The casino opened in 2010 and employs around 1,000 people. It is the second Philadelphia-area casino to close in recent months, after Parx Casino shuttered its Hollywood studio location in December.</p>
<p>SugarHouse has been dealt a difficult hand in recent years. The opening of new casinos in neighboring states has taken away much of its customer base, and its location on the Delaware River has made it difficult to compete with casinos located closer to urban areas.</p>
<p>In a statement, the casino said it had “made every effort to remain competitive” but that “market conditions have proven too challenging.” It added that it was working with employees to help them find new jobs.</p>
<h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-to-Remain-Open-Following-Settlement-Agreement"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-to-Remain-Open-Following-Settlement-Agreement" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia to Remain Open Following Settlement Agreement"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia to Remain Open Following Settlement Agreement</h1><p>The SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia will remain open after the casino’s owner reached a settlement agreement with the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The settlement agreement comes after the state of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against the casino’s owner, Philadelphia Entertainment and Development Partners (PEDP), in an attempt to block the casino from opening.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said that the state reached a settlement agreement with PEDP that will allow the casino to remain open while the company undergoes a series of reforms.</p>
<p>“My office will work with PEDP to ensure they meet their obligations under this agreement, which includes protecting taxpayers and ensuring gaming is conducted fairly and honestly at SugarHouse Casino,” Shapiro said.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement agreement, PEDP agreed to make a series of reforms to the casino, including hiring an independent monitor to oversee operations. The company also agreed to pay $4 million to the state.</p>
<p>SugarHouse Casino opened in 2010 and has been embroiled in a number of legal disputes with the state. In 2016, the state sued PEDP for violating its gaming license by using two former executives of the now-closed Atlantic City casino Trump Taj Mahal as consultants for SugarHouse Casino.</p>
<h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Set-to-Lose-Tax-Free-Status"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Set-to-Lose-Tax-Free-Status" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Set to Lose Tax-Free Status"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Set to Lose Tax-Free Status</h1><p>The SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia may soon lose its tax-free status, jeopardizing the casino’s future operations. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania ruled this week that the casino must start paying $40 million in taxes annually, a move that could force the casino to close its doors.</p>
<p>SugarHouse has long been exempt from paying taxes since it opened in 2010. The casino had argued that it should be exempt from taxes because it is located on Philadelphia’s waterfront and falls under the city’s jurisdiction. However, the court ruled this week that SugarHouse is actually located in the neighboring borough of Fishtown, making it subject to state and local taxes.</p>
<p>The decision is a major blow to the casino, which has already suffered from low revenues and layoffs over the past year. The casino has promised to appeal the ruling, but if it is ultimately forced to pay taxes, it may be unable to stay afloat.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-Philadelphia"><a href="#What-Does-This-Mean-for-Philadelphia" class="headerlink" title="What Does This Mean for Philadelphia?"></a>What Does This Mean for Philadelphia?</h1><p>The SugarHouse Casino is a major employer in Philadelphia, with over 1,500 workers. If the casino closes its doors, it will have a devastating impact on the local economy. In addition, the city would lose out on millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.</p>
<p>Philadelphia officials are hopeful that SugarHouse will be able to appeal the ruling and keep its doors open. However, if the casino does end up closing, it will leave a significant hole in the city’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Facing-Closure-Amidst-Mounting-Debt"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Facing-Closure-Amidst-Mounting-Debt" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Facing Closure Amidst Mounting Debt"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Facing Closure Amidst Mounting Debt</h1><p>The SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia is facing closure amidst mounting debt. According to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the casino is more than $286 million in debt. This has led to speculation that the casino may be forced to close its doors.</p>
<p>The casino has been struggling with debt for some time now. In 2017, it was reported that the casino was more than $180 million in debt. At the time, it was believed that the debt would be manageable. However, the situation has only worsened in recent months.</p>
<p>The closure of the SugarHouse Casino would be a major blow to Philadelphia’s economy. The casino employs more than 2,500 people and generates millions of dollars in revenue each year. It also helped attract other businesses to the city’s waterfront district.</p>
<p>If the casino does close, it is not clear what will happen to its employees. Some of them may be able to find jobs at other casinos in the area, but many others may find themselves out of work.</p>
<p>In addition to its debt problems, the SugarHouse Casino has also been hit by allegations of corruption. Last year, two former executives of the casino were indicted on charges of fraud and money laundering. The two men are accused of taking millions of dollars from the casino for their personal benefit.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the SugarHouse Casino will survive its financial troubles or if it will be forced to close its doors</p>
<h1 id="SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Seeks-to-Raise-Money-Via-Tax-Hike"><a href="#SugarHouse-Casino-in-Philadelphia-Seeks-to-Raise-Money-Via-Tax-Hike" class="headerlink" title="SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Seeks to Raise Money Via Tax Hike"></a>SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia Seeks to Raise Money Via Tax Hike</h1><p>Philadelphia’s SugarHouse Casino is hoping to secure an increase in taxes from its current rate of 54 percent to 58 percent in order to improve its financial position. The casino, which opened in 2010, has been unable to keep pace with its rivals in terms of revenue and profits. </p>
<p>The casino currently pays more than $40 million in taxes to the city and state. In order to make up for lost profits, the casino is now seeking permission from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to raise its tax rate. The higher taxes would bring in an additional $8 million per year. </p>
<p>While the hike is modest, it would still be a welcomed relief for SugarHouse Casino, which has seen its revenue decline by 11 percent over the past two years. In addition, the casino has seen its share of winning players fall from 31 percent in 2016 to 26 percent last year. This decline has led to a drop in profits from $43 million in 2016 to $33 million last year. </p>
<p>Opposition to the proposed tax increase is expected, especially from other casinos in the state that are struggling to remain profitable. One such casino, Presque Isle Downs and Casino, has already announced that it will close down if the tax hike is approved. </p>
<p>Despite the opposition, SugarHouse Casino says that it needs the extra money in order to continue growing and competing against other casinos in the area.</p>

The casino has long been known for its liberal rules and loose slots, but management has had enough of cheaters who are stealing from other players.</p>
<p>“We’ve had it with these lowlifes who think they can take advantage of our guests,” said head of security Earl Gray. “We’re going to catch them and throw them out of the casino, and we may even press charges.”</p>
<p>The casino has put together a team of experienced security personnel to watch for cheats, and they are using the latest technology to help them identify cards that have been tampered with. In addition, the casino is issuing new guidelines for dealers to follow when dealing blackjack.</p>
<p>“We want our dealers to be vigilant in watching for any signs of cheating,” said Gray. “If they see something suspicious, they need to report it immediately.”</p>
<p>The crackdown on blackjack cheats is good news for honest players, who can now play without worrying about being taken advantage of by cheating scum. So if you’re planning a trip to Las Vegas, make sure you visit John Rosie’s Casino – where the odds are definitely in your favor!</p>

<p>The casino had been in dispute with its former owner of the game, who claimed that he was the rightful owner. However, the state ruled that the casino had lawfully acquired the game from another player, and was within its rights to continue operating it.</p>
<p>This ruling is seen as a major victory for the casino, and should help to clear up any ownership disputes going forward.</p>
<h1 id="Lawsuit-Settlement-determines-ownership-of-popular-blackjack-game"><a href="#Lawsuit-Settlement-determines-ownership-of-popular-blackjack-game" class="headerlink" title="Lawsuit Settlement determines ownership of popular blackjack game"></a>Lawsuit Settlement determines ownership of popular blackjack game</h1><p>The ownership of blackjack has been in dispute for many years. The game, which is believed to have originated in France in the 1700s, has been the subject of numerous lawsuits.</p>
<p>In 2006, a group of investors filed a lawsuit against the owner of a blackjack table at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. The investors claimed that they were not given their fair share of the profits from the game. A settlement was reached in 2009, determining that the casino would keep 66.7% of the profits from blackjack, while the investors would receive 33.3%.</p>
<p>In 2012, another group of investors filed a lawsuit against a casino in Atlantic City. They claimed that they were not given their fair share of the profits from blackjack. In this case, however, the court ruled in favor of the casino.</p>
<p>While it is unclear who owns the rights to blackjack, it is clear that there is money to be made from this popular game.</p>
<h1 id="Judge-rules-in-favor-of-John-Rosie’s-casino-in-blackjack-game-ownership-case"><a href="#Judge-rules-in-favor-of-John-Rosie’s-casino-in-blackjack-game-ownership-case" class="headerlink" title="Judge rules in favor of John Rosie’s casino in blackjack game ownership case"></a>Judge rules in favor of John Rosie’s casino in blackjack game ownership case</h1><p>John Rosie’s casino won a court case in which the judge ruled that Rosie was the rightful owner of the blackjack game. The casino alleged that two men, Tom and Jerry, had stolen the game from Rosie while he was away on vacation.</p>
<p>The two men claimed that they had found the game abandoned in a closet and had simply taken it for their own amusement. However, the judge ruled that there was more evidence to suggest that Tom and Jerry had stolen the game from Rosie. This included testimony from witnesses who said they had seen Tom and Jerry entering Rosie’s casino with a blackjack table shortly before it went missing.</p>
<p>Rosie’s casino has been accused of theft in the past, but this is the first time they have been able to win a court case against those accusations. This victory is likely to give them a boost in business, as customers will be confident that their games are fair and honest.</p>

The Missouri Gaming Commission ruled in Rosie’s favor this week, stating that the casino legitimately owns the game rights to blackjack.</p>
<p>The decision comes after months of legal battles between the two casinos, including lawsuits and countersuits. Joe’s Casino had argued that it owned the game rights due to an agreement made with the original inventor of blackjack, but the Gaming Commission found that no such agreement existed.</p>
<p>“This is a victory for common sense and fairness,” said Rosie in a statement to the press. “My casino has always operated honestly and within the law, and we will continue to do so.”</p>
<p>Rosie’s Casino is expected to resume operations immediately following the ruling, while Joe’s Casino is reportedly considering an appeal.</p>

        <h1 id="When-will-the-Paradise-Casino-reopen-on-Guam"><a href="#When-will-the-Paradise-Casino-reopen-on-Guam" class="headerlink" title="When will the Paradise Casino reopen on Guam?"></a>When will the Paradise Casino reopen on Guam?</h1><p>The Paradise Casino is a casino resort on the island of Guam, in the United States territory of Guam. The casino has been closed since it sustained heavy damage from Typhoon Soulik in July 2013.</p>
<p>On March 3, 2016, it was announced that the Paradise Casino will reopen on April 15, 2016. The casino resort is expected to include a new hotel, restaurants, and a retail area. The opening of the casino has been delayed several times in the past.</p>
<h1 id="What-caused-the-Paradise-Casino-to-close-on-Guam"><a href="#What-caused-the-Paradise-Casino-to-close-on-Guam" class="headerlink" title="What caused the Paradise Casino to close on Guam?"></a>What caused the Paradise Casino to close on Guam?</h1><p>The Paradise Casino on Guam north of Hagåtña closed its doors in late February 2019, leaving about 240 employees out of work. The shutdown was a complete surprise to the casino’s employees, who showed up for work one day and found the casino’s doors locked.</p>
<p>No official explanation has been given for the closure. Some believe that it may be related to the ongoing legal battle between the casino’s owner, AGDC, and its former tenant, Imperial Pacific International Holdings Limited (IPIHL).</p>
<p>In November 2018, IPIHL filed a lawsuit against AGDC, seeking damages of over $1 billion. The suit alleges that AGDC reneged on a contract signed in 2015 which would have allowed IPIHL to operate the casino.</p>
<p>AGDC has denied any wrongdoing, and has claimed that IPIHL failed to uphold its end of the agreement. In a statement released after the closure of the Paradise Casino, AGDC said that it was “deeply disappointed with IPIHL’s actions and their impact on our employees and our community.”</p>
<p>The future of the Paradise Casino remains uncertain. In the meantime, its former employees are scrambling to find new jobs.</p>
<h1 id="When-is-the-expected-reopening-date-for-the-Paradise-Casino"><a href="#When-is-the-expected-reopening-date-for-the-Paradise-Casino" class="headerlink" title="When is the expected reopening date for the Paradise Casino?"></a>When is the expected reopening date for the Paradise Casino?</h1><p>Paradise Casino is scheduled to reopen on December 22, just in time for the holiday season! The casino has been closed since June due to the devastating wildfires that swept through the area. Many employees have been out of work since then, so this is great news for them.</p>
<p>The casino is expected to be back up and running with all its usual games and attractions. This will be a welcome sight for the community, which has been struggling since the fires. The casino employs hundreds of people, so its reopening will bring much-needed jobs and economic stimulus to the area.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the Paradise Casino will be busy in the weeks leading up to Christmas! Be sure to stop by and check out all the festivities.</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-updates-on-when-the-Paradise-Casino-will-reopen"><a href="#Are-there-any-updates-on-when-the-Paradise-Casino-will-reopen" class="headerlink" title="Are there any updates on when the Paradise Casino will reopen?"></a>Are there any updates on when the Paradise Casino will reopen?</h1><p>As of now, there is no clear indication as to when the Paradise Casino will reopen. The latest reports suggest that the casino may not be open until late 2019 or early 2020. This timeline is still tentative and could change depending on a number of factors.</p>
<p>The Paradise Casino was badly damaged by the Camp Fire in November 2018. The building was completely destroyed, and the property suffered significant damage as well. Rebuilding efforts are underway, but they are expected to take some time.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Paradise Casino’s staff and customers are dealing with the aftermath of the fire. Many people have lost their homes and livelihoods in the disaster, and the casino provides a much-needed source of income for many locals.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the Paradise Casino will reopen in light of these circumstances. However, we can be sure that it will reopen eventually and that it will continue to be a major employer and community asset in Northern California.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-plans-for-the-Paradise-Casino-once-it-reopens"><a href="#What-are-the-plans-for-the-Paradise-Casino-once-it-reopens" class="headerlink" title="What are the plans for the Paradise Casino once it reopens?"></a>What are the plans for the Paradise Casino once it reopens?</h1><p>The Paradise Casino is scheduled to reopen on May 1, 2019. According to the casino’s website, they are “currently renovating our gaming floor and restaurants with new amenities and features that we know our guests will love.” So far, there has been no announcements about what the new plans are for the casino.</p>
<p>The Paradise Casino is located in Biloxi, Mississippi. It first opened in 1992 with only slots and video poker machines. In 1995, they began offering table games. In 2009, they were acquired by Boyd Gaming Corporation. In 2012, they underwent a $10 million renovation which added a new poker room, high limit area, and buffet.</p>
<p>The most recent closure of the casino came after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The casino shut down for six months due to damage from the hurricane. It then closed again in August of 2010 when Mississippi legalized gambling on cruise ships. This led to a decline in business for the casino and it eventually closed its doors for good in February of 2011.</p>
<p>There is no word yet on what the exact plans are for the reopening of the casino, but we can certainly expect something big!</p>
