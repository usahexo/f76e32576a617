Casinos have long been a staple of entertainment and a place where people can go to try their luck. Roulette is one of the most popular casino games and has been around for centuries. While people have long suspected that there is some sort of bias in the game, nobody has been able to conclusively say whether or not this is the case. A new study from the University of California, Irvine may have finally answered this question.

The study found that, on average, there are an even number of bacon on a roulette wheel. This means that players have no inherent advantage when playing the game. The study also found that there was no bias in terms of which numbers were more likely to appear. This means that players can rest assured knowing that any number on the roulette wheel has an equal chance of appearing.

While this news may come as a surprise to some, it is likely to be welcomed by casino players around the world. It means that they can now enjoy this classic game without having to worry about any biased outcomes.

2. Cut out a 6-inch hole in the center of the circle.

3. Cover the hole with duct tape or another type of strong tape. This will be where the bacon goes.

4. Cover the rest of the circle with paper or fabric to create the outside of the wheel. You can use any color or pattern you like.

5. Make a stand for your wheel out of more cardboard or plywood. The stand should be about 10 inches high and have a notch in the middle so that the wheel can rest on it securely.
