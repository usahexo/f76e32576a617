#  Aston Martin Used in Casino Royale for Free Penny Slots

Aston Martin, the car made famous by the fictional British secret agent James Bond, was used in the movie Casino Royale for free penny slots. The car was loaned to the production crew by its owner, an Arab sheikh.

The sheikh is a big fan of James Bond and was more than happy to loan his prized possession to the production crew for use in the movie. In fact, he even offered to let them keep the car after filming was completed, but they declined his offer.

The Aston Martin is one of only two in existence that were built specifically for the movie. The other is owned by the producers of Casino Royale. The car is a DB9 Volante convertible and has a top speed of almost 190 miles per hour.

The sheikh purchased the car at an auction for $2.7 million and has been featured in magazines and on television all over the world. He says that driving it is like "flying" and that it's one of his favorite possessions.
