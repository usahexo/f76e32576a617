#  Son, you're too young to get into a casino in Las Vegas.2. How old do you have to be to get into a casino in Las Vegas?

There is no definitive answer to this question as casinos in Las Vegas vary in their age requirements. However, the general rule of thumb is that you must be at least 21 years old to enter a casino in Las Vegas. This applies to both locals and visitors alike.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, the Excalibur Hotel and Casino allows guests 18 and over on weekdays from 6 am to 11 pm and on weekends from 8 am to 11 pm. The Mirage also has a similar policy, allowing guests 18 and over during most hours of the day with the exception of 9 pm to 5 am when it is 21+.

If you are looking to gamble but are not quite of legal age yet, there are other options available for you in Las Vegas. Many of the hotels have arcades with games that do not require identification for entry. There are also a number of attractions in Las Vegas such as the fountains at Bellagio or the lions at MGM Grand that do not require you to be 21 years old or older.

The minimum age to get into a casino in Las Vegas is 21 years old. You must be at least 21 years old to gamble in the casinos in Las Vegas.

# 4. How old do I have to be to get into a casino in Las Vegas?

There is no definitive answer as there are different casinos which have their own age requirements. However, the legal gambling age in Las Vegas is 21 years old so most casinos will require you to be at least that age to gamble. There are a few exceptions though, such as the Golden Nugget which allows 18-year-olds to gamble â€“ but only if they are accompanied by someone over 21.

# 5. Can I bring my 18 year old son into a casino in Las Vegas?

The answer to this question depends on the casino. Most casinos in Las Vegas have an age limit of 21, but some casinos will allow 18 year olds. The best way to find out is to call the casino you are interested in and ask them directly.

If your son is 18 years old or older, he can enter the casino, but he cannot gamble. He can only play slot machines if he is accompanied by someone over the age of 21. If your son is under 18 years old, he cannot enter the casino at all.
