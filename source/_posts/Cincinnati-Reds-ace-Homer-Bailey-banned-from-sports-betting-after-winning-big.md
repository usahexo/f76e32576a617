#  Cincinnati Reds ace Homer Bailey banned from sports betting after winning big

Homer Bailey, the ace pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds, has been banned from sports betting by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred after winning big on a wager.

 Bailey is one of several high-profile athletes who have been caught betting on sports in the past, and Manfred doesn't want any more scandals involving professional players.

"Homer Bailey is not allowed to place any bets on any sport, at any time, for the rest of his life," Manfred said in a statement.

Bailey released a statement apologizing for his actions and accepting the commissioner's ruling.

"I'm sorry for my mistake and I accept the punishment that has been handed down to me by Commissioner Manfred," Bailey said. "I'm disappointed in myself and I promise that I will never bet on sports again."

This isn't the first time that Bailey has been caught gambling; he was also banned from betting on baseball in 2007 after being caught placing bets with a bookie.

#  Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun also banned from sports betting

Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun has been banned from sports betting, effective immediately. The announcement was made jointly by MLB and the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

"Our sports wagering policy prohibits players and other employees of our member clubs from placing bets on illegal or prohibited activities," said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement. "Ryan Braun has admitted to violating that policy and therefore is subject to discipline."

Braun will be able to continue participating in all other aspects of MLB, including games and award ceremonies. This is the first time a player has been banned from sports betting for violating the policy.

The 34-year-old is coming off a disappointing season in which he hit .236 with 14 home runs and 52 RBIs. He is currently owed $126 million over the next five years.

#  St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Jhonny Peralta suspended for 50 games

The St. Louis Cardinals announced Sunday that shortstop Jhonny Peralta has been suspended for 50 games following a positive test for performance-enhancing drugs.

"I apologize to my teammates, coaches and Cardinals fans," Peralta said in a statement. "I accept full responsibility for my actions and I will serve my suspension as required by the MLB drug policy."

Peralta, 31, is batting .301 with seven home runs and 29 RBIs in 76 games this season. He is in the first year of a four-year, $53 million contract he signed with the Cardinals last offseason.

The Cardinals are expected to replace Peralta with rookie Daniel Descalso.

#  Pittsburgh Pirates infielder Clint Barmes banned from sports betting indefinitely

On Thursday, the Pittsburgh Pirates infielder Clint Barmes was banned from sports betting indefinitely by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. The ban comes as a direct result of Barmes placing an $800 wager on the Milwaukee Brewers to win the National League Central Division.

"It's something that I take full responsibility for," Barmes said in a statement released by the team. "I made a mistake and I'm sorry. I apologize to my teammates, the organization and the fans."

Barmes is the second player to be banned for gambling this season, following New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard, who was banned for placing a $10 bet on his own team to win.

MLB has been cracking down on gambling in recent years, with new regulations being put in place in 2015 that prohibit players from betting on baseball games.

#  Chicago Cubs outfielder Alfonso Soriano to receive full immunity


When the Chicago Cubs acquired outfielder Alfonso Soriano from the Texas Rangers in early 2007, they were getting a player with a lot of baggage. Soriano had been involved in several high-profile incidents during his time with the Rangers, and many observers felt he was a malcontent who needed to be traded.

However, Soriano has proven to be a model citizen since coming to the Cubs. He has never caused any trouble off the field, and he has been one of the team's most productive players. In fact, Soriano's play this season may have earned him full immunity from trade speculation.

Soriano is in the final year of his contract, and there had been some speculation that he might be traded before the July 31 deadline. However, Cubs general manager Jim Hendry said on Sunday that Soriano will not be traded and will remain with the team for the remainder of the season.

"Alfonso is an important part of our club," Hendry said. "He's having a great year and is really enjoying playing in Chicago."

Hendry also said that he plans to discuss a contract extension with Soriano's agent after the season. The 34-year-old Soriano is batting .290 with 19 homers and 64 RBI this season, and he is among the team leaders in several offensive categories.

The Cubs are currently in first place in the National League Central Division, and they appear to have a legitimate shot at making it to the World Series this year. Soriano has been a big part of their success, and it would be foolish to trade him now.
