#  Poker Pro Reveals How Many Hands You Need To Win

Strategy is the lifeblood of poker. Just as importantly, though, is bankroll management. You can't play the game if you don't have the funds and you can't win if you don't have a sound strategy.

To be successful in poker, you need to find the right balance between the two. Winning strategies and sensible bankroll management are essential for any player, whether they are just starting out or are a seasoned pro.

In this article, we're going to take a look at some of the basics of bankroll management and how it applies to poker. We'll also discuss how many hands you need to win in order to break even in poker.

Basic Bankroll Management Guidelines

Most professional poker players recommend a bankroll of at least 100 buy-ins for no-limit games. This means that if the average buy-in for a game is $100, then you should have at least $10,000 set aside specifically for playing poker.

For limit games, the recommended bankroll is usually 50 buy-ins. This gives you enough room to absorb swings without risking your entire bankroll on any one hand.

Once you have your bankroll set up, it's important to stick to these guidelines:

Never play with money that you cannot afford to lose. This is especially important when starting out; don't risk your rent money or food budget on a game of poker.

. This includes both your bankroll and any other money that you may owe someone else. Only play in games where you have an edge over the competition . If you're not confident in your ability to beat your opponents, then it's best not to play at all.





If you're not confident in your ability to beat your opponents, then it's best not to play at all. Don't increase your stakes without justification . If your wins haven't been consistent over a period of time, then don't start playing higher stakes games until you've proven that you can beat those players consistently.





#  Expert Tips: How To Tell If You're Evolving At Poker

In poker, the cardinal rule is to always be learning. The games are constantly evolving, and so must the players if they want to stay ahead of the pack.

How do you know if you're evolving at poker? Here are some expert tips:

1. Study the Game

The first step to evolving at poker is to study the game. Learn as much as you can about the different variants, and how the game is played. This will give you a good foundation on which to build your skills.

2. Play Poker Online

Playing poker online is a great way to improve your skills. You can play in all sorts of different games, and against all sorts of different players. This will help you to learn new strategies and improve your game.

3. Watch Instructional Videos

There are plenty of instructional videos available online that can help you to improve your poker skills. They can teach you everything from basic strategy to advanced techniques. Watching these videos will help you to develop a well-rounded understanding of poker.

4. Join a Poker Forum

Joining a poker forum is a great way to get advice from experts and other players alike. You can ask any questions you have, and learn from the experiences of others. This can help you to improve your game rapidly.

#  Study Shows Eight Is The Magic Number When Winning At Poker

Playing poker is all about making the right decisions at the right time. One of the most important decisions you make is how much money to bet.

A recent study has shown that betting eight times your original bet (or chip stack) is the optimal amount to increase your chances of winning.

The study was conducted by two Canadian researchers, who analyzed data from over two million hands of poker. They found that when a player raised more than eight times their original bet, they were less likely to win than when they raised eight times or less.

While this rule doesn't always hold true (there are plenty of other factors at play in any given hand), it's a good guideline to keep in mind when making your bets.

So next time you're playing poker, remember to raise your bet in increments of eight!

#  Are You Evolving Quickly Enough In Poker? This Study Shows The Way

In a poker game, as in life, it is important to constantly be evolving and improving. Otherwise, you will quickly fall behind the competition.

According to a study recently conducted by scientists at the University of California, Riverside, however, this is not always easy to do. The study found that most people only make minor changes in their behavior from one year to the next.

"The majority of people are actually quite consistent in their behaviors over time," said study author Dr. Kit Gilkison in a statement. "This isn't necessarily bad, but it means that most individuals are not taking advantage of opportunities to learn and grow."

So how can you make sure that you are evolving quickly enough in poker? And what can you do if you find yourself stuck in a rut?

Here are three tips:

1) Be open to change. The first step is simply being willing to change your behavior. If you're not open to new ideas, you're going to have a hard time improving your game.

2) Evaluate your playing style. Take some time to evaluate your playing style and ask yourself if there's anything you can improve on. Maybe you're too aggressive or too passive. Maybe you need to work on your bluffing skills. The key is figuring out what specific areas you need to focus on and then addressing them head-on.

3) Study the game. One of the best ways to improve your game is by studying the nuances of poker. There's a lot to learn and it can be challenging, but it's well worth the effort in the long run. There are plenty of resources available online and offline, so there's no excuse for not getting started today!

#  Shocking Stats: 88% Of Poker Players Fail To Evolve

It’s no secret that the game of poker is a constantly evolving one. What worked in the past may not work today, and what works today may not work tomorrow. This is why it’s so important for poker players to constantly be learning and evolving with the game.

Unfortunately, though, most poker players fail to do this. In fact, a shocking 88% of all poker players never evolve their game!

So why is it that so many poker players fail to evolve? There are a number of reasons, but the main ones are:

1) Lack of knowledge – Many poker players simply don’t know enough about the game to be able to evolve their playing style. They may know the basics, but they don’t know enough about the latest strategies and techniques to be able to use them effectively.

2) Lack of motivation – Another reason why many poker players fail to evolve is because they lack the motivation to do so. They may be content with their current level of play and see no need to improve.

3) Fear of change – Many poker players are reluctant to change their game because they fear that it will not work as well for them as their current approach. They’re afraid of making mistakes and losing money, so they stick with what they know instead of trying something new.

If you want to be successful at poker, you need to break out of these habits and start evolving your game. Here are some tips on how to do that:

1) Educate yourself – The best way to learn about the latest strategies and techniques is to educate yourself on them. There are plenty of books, articles and videos out there on how to improve your poker game, so make sure you take advantage of them!

2) Get motivated – To get motivated, you need to set goals for yourself and have a desire to achieve them. Once you have these things in place, you’ll be more motivated than ever before to improve your game!

3) Be willing to experiment – Don’t be afraid to experiment with new strategies and techniques in order to find what works best for you. You may make some mistakes along the way, but that’s ok – learn from them and move on.
