#  What is blackjack game Brazil?

There are some variants of the blackjack game, but the classic version is the most popular. The game is very simple – you play against the dealer, and your aim is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Cards are worth their face value, and an Ace counts as either 1 or 11, depending on what you need. If you beat the dealer’s hand without going bust, you win!

The game originated in France in the 18th century, and has been enjoyed by millions of people around the world ever since. There are versions of blackjack available in casinos all over the globe, but Brazil is home to a particularly exciting version of the game – Ponta Pelada.

Ponta Pelada blackjack is a fast-paced variation of the game that typically features 6 decks of cards (rather than the standard 2 or 4). This makes for a more unpredictable experience, as players will often be hit with surprise card combinations. In addition, there are no jokers in play, so make sure you know your card values!

Ponta Pelada blackjack is usually played with bets of between 20 and 200 reais (about $5-$50), so it’s perfect for players of all budgets. If you want to try your luck at this thrilling Brazilian variant of blackjack, be sure to check out one of our recommended online casinos!

#  How to play the Rikvip blackjack game?

Rikvip is a casino game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to score 21 points or as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer’s hand.

To play Rikvip blackjack, first you need to place your bet by clicking on the chip denominations at the bottom of the screen. You can bet up to 10 chips at a time. Once you have placed your bet, click on the “Deal” button. You will be dealt two cards face up and the dealer will be dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.

Your aim is to beat the dealer’s hand. To do this, you need to add together the value of your two cards, and if it is higher than the dealer’s card, you win. If your total equals 21 (or is closer to 21 than the dealer’s), you are said to have Blackjack and automatically win regardless of what the dealer has.

If your total is lower than 21, you can choose whether to hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what you’ve got). If you go over 21, you bust and lose automatically. If the dealer has a natural Blackjack (an ace and a 10 or face card), all players except those who also have blackjacks lose automatically.
