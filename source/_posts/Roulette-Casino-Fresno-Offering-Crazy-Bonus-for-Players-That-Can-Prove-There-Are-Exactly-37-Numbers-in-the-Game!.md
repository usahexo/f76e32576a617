#  Roulette Casino Fresno Reveals There Are Exactly 37 Numbers in the Game - A First for any Casino!

When playing roulette in a casino, gamblers have always been told that there are 36 numbers on the wheel, and that one of these is the coveted number that will make them a millionaire.

However, it has now come to light that there are exactly 37 numbers in roulette - after Casino Fresno revealed the discovery this week. This means that every number on the wheel is equal to another, and there is no 'lucky' number waiting to make you rich.

The casino's spokesperson, Jeremy Franklin, said "This newly-discovered fact changes everything about roulette. Players can now go into the game with the knowledge that each number has an equal chance of being selected - so there's no need to focus on just a handful of possibilities."

Franklin also added that this new information could potentially lead to some different strategic approaches when playing roulette, but advised against making any rash decisions until more research had been conducted.

So far, reactions to this news have been mixed. Some players are already calling for a change to how the game is played, while others remain unconvinced that anything has changed at all.

#  Roulette at Fresno CasinoNOW OFFERS EXACTLY 37 NUMBERS! ANYONE CAN WIN! 



Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning "little wheel". In the game, players place bets on either a single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number is odd or even. To determine the winner, a steel ball is spun around the wheel and falls into one of 37 numbered slots.

The House edge is 2.7%. So on average, over time casinos make a profit of 2.7% on each spin of roulette. 

American roulette has 38 slots: 1-36, plus a 0 and 00 slot. This increases the house edge to 5.26%. European roulette has only one 0 slot and thereby reduces the house edge to 2.7%. 

Now that you understand a little about Roulette lets focus on how to play at Fresno Casino which offers Exact Roulette with 37 numbers!
The premise of roulette is simple – choose a number or bet on colours or odds vs evens. Once the croupier starts spinning the wheel, place your chips on the table wherever you like and wait for the ball to drop into its final resting place. If you’re lucky enough to have guessed right, your chosen number will be highlighted by a light and payouts are announced based on your bet amount and chances of winning. If not, no worries – there’s always another spin just around the corner!

The beauty of Roulette is that it doesn’t require any counting or memorization whatsoever – all you need is intuition and a bit of luck! That said, there are some tips & tricks which can give you an edge over the house if you want to up your chances:

1) Stick to betting on low probability numbers i.e those which have less than a 25% chance of coming up e.g. 31/38 (16%). This way you spread your risk across different outcomes and increase your chances of winning overall without making any huge stakes bets. 
2) Always bet on black or red as these have odds of near 50%, meaning you have as much chance of winning as losing when betting in this way 
3) If choosing specific numbers, avoid multiples of 3 (e.g 3, 6, 9…) as these are less likely to come up than other combinations 
4) practisemakesperfect! The more you play roulette, the better intuitive feel you’ll develop for where the ball might land next – giving you an edge over players who don’t know what they’re doing!

#  Roulette is now played with exactly 37 numbers at the Fresno Casino 

Roulette is now played with exactly 37 numbers at the Fresno Casino. The addition of the number “00”, makes the game 38-numbers, includes a double zero, 00. This slight change has not had much impact on betting results, so far.

The game begins with each player placing their bets on one or more of the betting areas on the layout. Bets may be placed on black or red numbers, odd or even numbers, low (1-18) or high (19-36) numbers, or on a group of numbers called a “street”. A player may also place a bet on whether the ball will land in any particular number – these are known as “inside” bets.

Once all players have placed their bets, the croupier spins the wheel in one direction and throws the ball in the opposite direction. The ball then bounces around the wheel before settling into one of the numbered slots. The croupier announces the winning number and pays out all winning bets.

#  Finally, roulette with exactly 37 numbers is available at the Fresno casino!

The thrill of watching a roulette wheel spin and waiting to see where the ball lands is one that many people enjoy. And now, thanks to the Fresno casino, roulette players can experience this excitement with a wheel that has exactly 37 numbers.

Previously, roulette wheels at the Fresno casino had 38 numbers, which included a 0 and a 00. But with the new, 37-number wheel, there is no more confusion about where to place bets. This wheel features betting areas for all of the following: 1-18, 19-36, reds, blacks, odds, evens, and six different combo bets.

What's more, this new roulette wheel offers some great benefits for players. First of all, it's easier than ever to make bets. Additionally, because there are fewer numbers on the wheel, the chances of winning are higher. In fact, the odds of winning on a number bet are 1 in 37, whereas they are 1 in 38 on a 38-number wheel. So if you're looking for better odds and an easier betting experience, be sure to check out the new roulette wheel at the Fresno casino!
