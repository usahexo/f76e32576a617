#  Atlantic City Casinos Finally Legalize Online Gambling

The legality of online gambling has been a topic of debate for many years. Atlantic City casinos are finally making the move to legalize it. Many people are in favor of this, as it will create new jobs and bring in more money to the state.

There are many who oppose online gambling, however. They feel that it is a form of addiction that can be addictive and dangerous. They also believe that it can lead to financial ruin for those who engage in it.

Despite the opposition, the Atlantic City casinos seem set on legalizing online gambling. This is sure to be a boon to the local economy, as well as providing a new way for people to enjoy casino games.

#  New era dawns for gambling in Atlantic City as online casinos are legalized

On October 26, 2017, New Jersey casino regulators approved the offering of online casino gambling licenses. This was a momentous decision for Atlantic City, as it represents the dawn of a new era for gambling in the city.
