#  Bitcoin Site Payments Reach $1 Million In Less Than Three Months!

Bitcoin, the new software-based digital currency, is starting to make waves in the online world. On September 2nd, a Reddit user announced that they had received their first bitcoin payment for goods and services rendered. In the three short months since then, the number of businesses accepting bitcoin as payment has exploded.

What is Bitcoin?

Created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a digital currency based on mathematical proof. It is not regulated by any government or central bank. Using peer-to-peer technology, transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.

How Does Bitcoin Work?


When someone wants to pay for something using bitcoin, they need to possess a bitcoin wallet - just like you need a real world wallet to carry your cash around in. The wallet is a computer file that stores your bitcoins. You can either download a software bitcoin wallet or use an online service. There are also physical wallets that store the virtual currency offline.


Once you have your wallet set up, you need to acquire some bitcoins. You can do this by buying them on an exchange or accepting them as payment for goods or services rendered. Bitcoins aren't printed like regular money; they're produced by people running computers all around the world using software that solves mathematical problems. This process is known as mining . For every problem solved, one block of bitcoins is generated. At present, 25 bitcoins are generated per block mined . The amount of new bitcoins released with each mined block diminishes gradually over time until it reaches zero in 2140 .

The value of Bitcoin has historically been extremely volatile . In January 2013 , one bitcoin was worth $13 . By December 2013 , its value had jumped to $1,000 . As of February 2015 , one bitcoin was worth about $225 .
